Once Tongariro, Ruapehu, Ngaruhoe and Taranaki all stood next to each other. Nearby stood Pihanga who was covered in a cloak of deep green forest so stunning that Taranaki and Tongariro fought for her affections. When the battle ended the lovely Pihanga stood close by Tongariro's side.Taranaki, wild with grief and jealously wrenched his roots from the ground and left the other mountains. He plunged towards the setting sun, gouging out a deep wide trench behind him, as he wept the trench filled to become the Whanganui River.
