Rotorua translates as 'Second lake'; roto means lake and rua two. Kahumatamomoe was the uncle of the Māori chief Ihenga, the ancestral explorer of the Te Arawa. It was the second major lake the chief discovered, and he dedicated it to his uncle.Situated in the middle of Lake Rotorua is Mokoia Island where legendary Tutanekai lived. He was forbidden from marrying his lover Hinemoa. Her father Umukaria, a chief from the shores of the lake, separated the star-crossed lovers by ordering that his daughter not be allowed to travel by canoe to Tutanekai's tribal village on the island. Each night he sat on the shore playing sad songs on his flute. The tunes would float across the water and make Hinemoa miss him even more.One night Hinemoa was so compelled by aroha she wrapped herself in calabashes and swam 3.2kms across the lake to the island guided by the sound of Tutanekai's flute playing. Not wanting to be caught naked, Hinemoa waited at a drinking pool for her lover to come to her. At first Tutanekai did not know who was teasing him in the dark, but Hinemoa stepped out of the water he was struck by her beauty and offered his cloak to her.In the morning a slave alerted Tutanekai’s family that four feet where in his bedchambers! They realised who it was as Hinemoa’s whanau travelled across the lake on waka. But instead of fighting the two tribes formed a lasting peace allowing Tutanekai and Hinemoa to be together.
