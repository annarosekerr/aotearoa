Manata was the beautiful daughter of a local chief who was forbidden to marry the man she loved, Matakauri. One night she was kidnapped by a fierce giant called Matau and her father was so distraught he offered her hand in marriage to anyone who would rescue her.

Matakauri snuck into Matau's lair and later the two lovers were married. But the chief wanted to ensure the giant would never hurt his whanau again so he went to the liar and set the giant on fire.

The great giant burned to death in his sleep, melting snow and creating the "S" shape in the valley. His head rested at Glenorchy and his feet at Kinston, so Queenstown is where his knees were.

It's said that while you can kill a giant you can never destroy his heart, which explains why lake Wakatipu rises and falls by about 12cm every five minutes. Some say that you can still see the beating heart of Matau in the lake.
