One day while Poutini was bathing he saw a beautiful woman named Waitaiki and decided he wanted her. He snatched her and fled south towards the mainland.

When Waitaiki's husband Tamaahua, a powerful chief, realised she had been taken he threw a magical dart in the air which would point him in the direction of her. Poutini continued to flee lighting fires along the way to keep Waitaiki warm. When the reached Milford Sound she begged him to let her go. Poutini listened to her and started to carry her back while she wept.

In close pursuit Tamaahua saw his wife's tears persevered in Browenite stone and prepared to fight for her the next day. Poutini grew concerned and thought if he couldn't have Waitaiki then no one could. He turned her in pounamu stone and laid her body in the cold river.

In the morning Tamaahua found his wife transformed into stone and went home grieving. His tangi (song of grief) can still be heard through the mountains.
