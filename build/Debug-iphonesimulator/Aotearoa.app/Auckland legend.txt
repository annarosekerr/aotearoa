One day the giant Mataho was feeling cold and asked the gods to send fire to warm him. They responded by creating over sixty fiery eruptions that now form Auckland city. Mataho became known as the god of volcanoes.When the volcanos cooled off fairy people came to inhabit the misty darkness of the hills. One group lived in the Waitakere ranges and another in the Hunua ranges.A war broke out in Pakuranga after Wairere, the daughter of Hunua, eloped with Hui, the son of Waitakere. On the first night of battle the Hunua people made the sun rise before the proper time and many Waitakere warriors died in the blinding light.The Waitakere people were very angry about being defeated so the next night they dug into the ground and stole magic from Mataho, which caused volcanic fires. Mataho was furious and turned the fires towards the Waitakere ranges engulfing the forests in flame.The Waitakere people begged the gods for rain to quench the fire, and to this day more rain falls in the Waitakere than any other region.
