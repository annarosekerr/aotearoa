Named from Te Reinga meaning ‘The leaping place’. It is believed that after death a person's wairua stays with mourning relatives for three days before embarking on a journey to the northern most point of New Zealand. They climb along the rocky ridges of Te One Roa a Tohe (Ninety Mile Beach) before making their way to an ancient pohutukawa tree that sits on a rock below the cliff. From here the wairua leaps into a watery underworld below.Many believe they only stay in the underworld briefly and then make their way to the far homeland, Hawiaki.
