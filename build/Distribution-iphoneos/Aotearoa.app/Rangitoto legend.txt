A man named Uenuku who lived in Hawaiki had a bad boil on his bum. He threw out the dressings which had been covering his ailment, but Tama-te-kupua’s family dog Potaka-tawhiti was caught eating these dicards. Uenuku was so mad he cooked and ate the dog and when Tama-te-kupua and his brother went searching for their pet they heard him growl from Uenuku’s stomach.This started a great war between the two families and Tama-te-Kuapa decided to seek a new home. He gathered a crew for his waka named Te Arawa and they sailed to Aotearoa.When the ship got to the Hauraki Gulf they found the Tainui people already settled there. A battle was fought on the island at the beach now know as Islington Bay. Te Arawa’s crew suffered a great defeat which is how the island got its full name Nga Rangi-i-totongia--Tama-te-kupua which translates to ‘the days of bleeding of Tama-te-kapu’.
