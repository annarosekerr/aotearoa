Maui was a demi-god, who lived in Hawaiiki. One day when he was very young, he hid in the bottom of his brothers' boat in order to go out fishing with them. Once out at sea, Maui was discovered by his brothers, but they were not able to take him back to shore so the brothers continued rowing, and once they were far out into the ocean Maui dropped his magic fishhook over the side of the waka. After a while he felt a strong tug on the line. This seemed to be too strong a tug to be any ordinary fish, so Maui called to his brothers for assistance.There was much straining and pulling, when suddenly surfaced a giant fish. Against Mauiâ€™s advice his brothers began hacking at the fish causing all the mountains and valleys that run down the spine of the North Island. The waka they were in became the South Island.Stewart Island, which lies at the very bottom of New Zealand, is known as Te Punga a Maui as it was the anchor holding Maui's waka as he pulled in the giant fish.
