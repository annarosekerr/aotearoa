Pania was a woman of the sea, but at night she would sleep at the Ahuriri harbour. One night a young man named Karitoki discovered her there and they got married. She visited her husband every night, but returned to the ocean at dawn. Together they conceived a child named Moremore, but Kariroki became worried the boy would be taken away by the sirens. An elder told him to wait until his wife and son were sleeping and place cooked food in their mouths so they would be bound to land. He did this, but a morepork called out warning Pania, she woke suddenly, spat out the food and went back to sea never returning to her husband.Pania is now a fishing rock and she can be seen when the sea is clam. She lays face downwards with her arms towards the shore. Under her left armpit live rock cod and snapper live under her right, between her thighs hapuku can be caught. Moremore became a taniwha gaurding the seafood of the harbour.
