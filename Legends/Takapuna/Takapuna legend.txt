The Tainui people sailed from Hawaiki to Aotearoa. When they arrived they found Te Arawa men had already claimed the land as their own, but the Tainui crew were clever and tricked them into thinking theyâ€™d arrived first. The crew settled near the Hauraki Gulf. Taka means assembly and puna means spring. This is where the Tainui men gathered to drink from the spring.
