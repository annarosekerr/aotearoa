While Kupe and his crew were discovering New Zealand the came across a frightened octopus. They followed the creature through the Cook Strait, but when they caught up with it the octopus lunged at them and wrapped its tentacles around the waka.

Kupe threw a gourd into the sea hoping to trick the octopus. Thinking a man had fallen overboard the octopus released the waka and turned to attack the gourd. Kupe then cut the octopus with his adze, chopping into its head as well as accidentally cutting some land away from the North and South Islands.

Kapiti Island is one of the pieces which got chopped away from the mainland in this battle.
