One day while Maui was resting an evil giant appeared. The warrior threw him into the ocean and piled mountains on top of him in the hopes of keeping him down.

The giant hibernated through winter, but when summer came he began to stir, causing the land to open near Akaroa Harbour. Maui continued throwing mountains on him, but he giant was waking up and his restlesness formed Pigeon Bay, Port Levy and Diamond Harbour.

By the time Maui managed to kill the giant he had thrown many mountains which now form the Banks Peninsula.
