Waikato comes from the words way meaning water and kato meaning pull. It refers to the mouth of the river which looks like it is being pulled into the sea.

Early inhabitants of Hamilton had a close relationship with the river which provided them with physical as well as spiritual nourishment. The famous saying "Waikato taniwha rau, he piko he taniwha" translates to meaning there are hundreds of taniwha in the Waikato river, so many that you'll find one at every bend.
