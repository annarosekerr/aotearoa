Kupe was a great explorer who rested in Wellington after traveling through the North Island. There is a rock in Seatoun named in this honour, Aroaro-o-Kupe meaning "the presence of Kupe".

He named the islands in the harbour after his daughters, Matiu (Somes Island) and MƒÅkaro (Ward Island).

When he left to explore more of the country he was gone so long people became worried. One of his daughters was so distraught that she jumped off a cliff on the Southern Coast. The rust-coloured stones in this area known as Pari-whero are said to be covered with her blood.

Kupe eventually rejoined his people in Hawaiiki where he told everyone about Aotearoa, the land of the long white cloud.
