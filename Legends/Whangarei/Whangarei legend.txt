Whanaga means harbour and rei is a treasured possesion.When wars broke out in Waikato a group of people moved to the far north. After settling for awhile a young chief named Ueoneone decided to return to their homeland. When he arrived he was introduced to the twins Reipae and Reitu and he could not decide which girl he loved most. Both sisters pined for him after he left.One day a bird arrived outside the whare and the sister’s jumped on his back so they could meet with the chief and ask whom he would marry. They were very close to their destination when Reipae asked the bird to let her down so she could relieve herself. On the harbour shores she met a man and the couple fell in love. The harbour became known as Whangarei, the place where Tahuhu-potiki met his cherished bride, Reipae. Reitu stayed on the bird’s back and was united to Ueoneone. She was soon married to the influential chief.
